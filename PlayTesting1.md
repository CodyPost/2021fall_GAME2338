> Yes Destiny 2's controls were understandable the controls were like every other FPS game but with some other simple controls. 

**Question:** During gameplay did you notice anything that shouldn't be in the game or could be removed and it wouldn't effect game play?

**Question:** Is this game balanced? If not, what is the target audience for this game based on that imbalance?
> yes destiny 2 is pretty balanced not in just gameplay but also the way it feels, inputs and FPS

**Question:** Does the timing of this game appear to be about right for this type of game?

**Question:** During gameplay did the mechanics and theme go together and reinforce each other?

**Question:** Did you have fun playing this game?
> yes I have been playing this game since 2018 and have taken some breaks but have kept coming back to play it. 

**Question:** During gameplay what problems or issues seemed to happen and how did you get them to reoccur?
