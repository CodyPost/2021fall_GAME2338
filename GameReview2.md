## Summary

No mans sky is not a typical RPG game, it is the game that you would think that an RPG should be made, it has stunning graphics, great mechanics, such as flying, shooting, running and, using a jetpack etc. Your character has to find out what is going on in this massive universe and trys to help a lost traveler such as yourself. The other story is your character has to find these sort of god like beings that can either destroy you and the entire universe or help you with anything you need. No mans sky takes place in a massive 91h total hours of gameplay that will keep you searching for around over 215h if you are a completionist. No mans sky was developed to fufill a "longtime-desireby Hello Games founder Sean Murray to create a space exploration game that captured the visiionand optimism of science fiction writings and art of the 1970's and 1980's.

## Final Thoughts

The thing I loved about this game was that it was complicated but it was also simple, it was not a game that took to much skill but it also had a lot of stuff to figure out and learn as you progress through the game. The most disappointing parts of the game is that it is not optimized properly, the game is laggy and it can crash very easily, and I would say that there are to many game breaking bugs like falling through the ground and in an infinite loop of just falling through the map.
