Some defining quality's of dying Light are the replayability of the game. the story itself is more than enough to want to keep playing, added on to that are the dlc. the gameplay is unique and a good mix of parkour and and zombies. what a dynamic duo. 
Destiny 2 has very good graphics but it also is optimized. the gameplay is also unique as it is a combo of super heroes and heaven and hell that have robots, other beings and gods, but dont forget that it has an amazing story that just keeps on telling. 
Apex is just like the others it is like no other it may be another battle royale but the mechanics and the way you move the weapons are all factors of fun but chaotic.
