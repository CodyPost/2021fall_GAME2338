## Summary

This game is set in the early 1980's. The story is based around Green Beret turned CIA SAD/SOG operative Russell Adlerand his misson to stop by any means necessary a USSR group in 1981. The Campaign is based on some real life events that happened such as East Berlin, Vietnam, Turkey, and the Soviet KGB Headquarters. Adlers team is composed of Call Of Duty Black Ops characters Alex Mason, Frank Woods, and Jason Hudson. For the campaign the palyer takes control of "Bell" Who is recruited by Adler into a multinational task force dedicated to bring down Perseus. The multiplayer ascpect introduces a battle pass system to where you can get free items or you can also buy the pass and get those free items as well as the buyable battle pass items. The Zombies story takes place after the events of Black ops 4, Samantha Maxis has grown up and is in a secret oraginization called requim. When I played cold war it was really fun and entertaining, the gameplay is fun new and fresh compared to all the other games, you have the slide  which was introduced back in black ops 3 but is more balanced and more realistic, such as you cant just infinitely slide cancel you can only do it once or twice the most at threes times, there are also emotes in the game, you can inspect your gun, the gun sounds are amazing and the recoil on most guns is very easy to handle, most of the stuff in the game is self explanatory so it is beginner friendly.

## Final Thoughts

All around I really liked the game I thought the campaign was very good even though in some parts I was a little confused but as you play more of the campaign you start to understand it better, the mechanics were very smooth and responded very fast. The only thing I did not like about the game was how many people just camped or hacked or glitched the game to help them get an edge over you.
