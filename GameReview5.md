## Summary

Monopoly is a real-estate board game for two to eight players which the players goal is to remain finacially solvent while making others into bankruptcy by buying and developing pieces of property. 
Each side of the square board into 10 smaller rectangles representing specific properties, railroads, utilitis, a jail, and other various places or events. at the start of the game each player is given a certain amount of monopoly money, the players then move around the board using two six sided dice. any player who lands on an unowned property may either purchase it, put it up for auction, or just not buy it depending on which set of rules you play by, while some squares require the player to draw a card that might be favorable or not. when a player gets a monopoly that means when someone gets all the propertys of the same color, in which that person will be able to put houses and then eventually put hotels on those select propertys and add more rent fees on those propertys.   

## Final Thoughts

The thing I loved about monopoly but can also hate is how long you can play, sometimes a game can take hours or even days, this can be bad but also good, it shows that this game is fun enough to keep playing, but takes to long to finish.
