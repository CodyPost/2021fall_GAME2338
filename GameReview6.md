## Summary

PUBG is based on a Movie called "Battle Royal". The film has students are taken onto an island and in order to survive they have to fight eachother and try to be the last person standing. In PUBG there are numerous Game Modes where a certain amount of players drop onto an island via airplane. Players can decide if they want to play singles, duos, or quads. when players land they can find various weaponry that can be used to either defend themselves or attack others. There are different elements to the game such as, medicine, health kits, pain killers, vehicles, various costumes, armors etc. all of these elemnts try to make the game as realistic as it can be. 

PUBG was first released as a beta program for microsoft in March 2017. Later it was publically released on steam on December 2017. Soon it was released on Xbox one by Microsoft. The game recieved good feedback and then was released for many other platforms. 

Some of the many/popular features of PUBG is the many maps and climate, a wide variety of weapons/vehicles, multiple characters including men and women, the customization of characters and weapons using different colors or paintjobs etc. 

## Final Thoughts

All in all I enjoyed almost every aspect of PUBG such as the weapons, the customizable characters/ vehicles and weaponry all of the maps or climates and the gunplay.
